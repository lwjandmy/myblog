The mainly problem are corrupted jars.

To find the corrupted one, you need to add a Java Exception Breakpoint in the Debugger View of Eclipse, or your preferred IDE, select the  java.util.zip.ZipException class, and restart Tomcat instance.

When the JVM suspends at ZipException breakpoint you must go to JarFile.getManifestFromReference() in the stack trace, and check attribute name to see the filename.

After that, you should delete the file from file system and then right click your project, select Maven, Update Project, check on Force Update of Snapshots/Releases.
```

添加异常断点java.util.zip.ZipException

在调用堆栈中找JarFile.getManifestFromReference()

查看属性name, 定位到出错的jar文件, 删掉jar, Maven -> Update Project, 勾选Force Update of Snapshots/Releases
