## zsh配置文件位置和加载顺序

```text
配置环境变量environment

/etc/zsh/zshenv
    This file should contain commands to set the global command search path and other system-wide environment variables; it should not contain commands that produce output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.
~/.zshenv
    Similar to /etc/zsh/zshenv but for per-user configuration. Generally used for setting some useful environment variables.


用户登录时配置, 注意这里支持/etc/profile

/etc/zsh/zprofile
    This is a global configuration file, it'll be sourced at login. Usually used for executing some general commands at login. Please note that on Arch Linux, by default it contains one line which source the /etc/profile, see #Global configuration files for details.
/etc/profile
    This file should be sourced by all Bourne-compatible shells upon login: it sets up an environment upon login and application-specific (/etc/profile.d/*.sh) settings. Note that on Arch Linux, Zsh will also source this by default.
~/.zprofile
    This file is generally used for automatic execution of user's scripts at login.


zsh启动时配置

/etc/zsh/zshrc
    Global configuration file, will be sourced when starting as a interactive shell.
~/.zshrc
    Main user configuration file, will be sourced when starting as a interactive shell.



zsh的login和logout, login在/etc/profile之后

/etc/zsh/zlogin
    A global configuration file, will be sourced at the ending of initial progress when starting as a login shell.
~/.zlogin
    Same as /etc/zsh/zlogin but for per-user configuration.
/etc/zsh/zlogout
    A global configuration file, will be sourced when a login shell exits.
~/.zlogout
    Same as /etc/zsh/zlogout but for per-user configuration.

```
